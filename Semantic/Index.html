    <p> This is one of the picture I took from my visit in October. The penguins were the first animals I saw upon entering and they just had the cutest presentation where they would walk to get a fish and let the next in line get theirs. It was all the more funny when the one that was always hungry just pushed the other penguins aside and hogged the fish for a little bit. They did some cool moves in the water so they definitely left an impression on me. </p>

    <h2> Why I like Penguins </h2>
    <p> They are just so adorable when they waddle and just look at them! They are precious animals. They are also entertaining to watch as they brawl for a fish. One reason I really liked penguins was after I had seen one in Looney Tunes and he was absolutely adorable. The way he convinced Bugs to take him to his homeland, which Bugs mistook for the South Pole. Another reason I really began to like them was that I went to see the movie Happy Feet and it was there that they played a cover of one of my favorite songs from Queen, Somebody to Love, and since then I just associated them with my favorite band until my love for them just grew. Recently I went to the Milwaukee Zoo and saw them in October and in July when one of the penguins had it's birthday celebrated on the 4th of July. They are the first animal you see upon entering the Zoo and it's not hard to see why. You can see them swim and do a bunch of fancy stuff while other animals such as the flamingos just stand there.</p>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
            <img src="Penguin2.jpg" alt="Penguin2" class="Penguin2">
            
    
   <li> <p>Penguins are magnificent creatures that you should see whenever you get the chance because they are the type of animals that you just want to hug upon seeing them. I just can't get enough of them. I can imagine myself at some point in the future having a pet penguin because I already have two stuffed animals, one large penguin and a small one. Just looking at it is enough to get my through the day.</p></li>
        
    
    <li><p>Four penguin species are endangered and we need to save not only these creatures, but all the animals that are endangered. I would certainly like to see these animals live for many years to come because it is sad that they die just to become somebody's trophy.To think that one animal's suffering is just another paycheck sickens me. I hope that all animals receive the protection and care they need because the only thing that poachers are doing to this world is destroying it.</p></li>
